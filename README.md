How to use this script:
1) Have Python installed (I used Python 2, but it shouldn't matter)
2) Launch IDLE
3) Load this script in IDLE
4) Click Run>Run Module (or press F5)
5) Perform mathematical operations, using the (lowercased) atomic symbols of the elements to represent their atomic masses (except arsenic and indium, which are represented by ars and ind since as and in are reserved in Python)

Other functions:
sqrt(num) returns the square root of num
rms(temp, mass) returns the root mean square velocity of the sample (celsius, grams)
eff(rate1, mass1, rate2, mass2) uses None for whichever of the 4 items you wish to find in a gas effusion problem and returns the value of that item
